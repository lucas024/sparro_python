# Sparro - Mid-Weight | Full Stack Python Developer Test
Thank you for taking the time to complete our Full Stack Dev Test. The test is setup to demonstrate your capabilities as a full stack developer, incorporating a mix of frontend and backend tasks.
- You will have **one week** to submit the test and you can spend as much time as you would like
- You do **not** need to provide a finished production-ready app, we are more interested in seeing how you tackle the tasks with critical thinking and how you demonstrate problem-solving through the use of technical solutions
- You will also be graded on the following criteria:
  - Ability to reproduce the design provided with consideration of web performance
  - Ability to implement implied functionality by interpreting the designs provided
  - Clean code structure and maintainability of code

## Task
 The primary task is to build a proof-of-concept shopping cart, wherby a user can add products to their cart and process the order through a checkout form
  - Fetch the product items from the provided `products.json` file to display on the *Product Listing* view based on the design
  - The cart contents should update in real-time when a user adds a product to the cart
  - Cart contents should persist throughout the users session, including on refresh, until the user clears their contents or places an order
  - Each submitted order should have a unique identifier and there should be checks in place to determine if it is unique
  - Upon checkout, the order data should be saved locally to a `.json` file labelled with the unique order ID e.g `order_2948281.json`

## Design
* We have provided the design as PNG screens to use for reference
* The design is mobile-first and thus should be optimised for current mobile devices

## Implementation
* Must use Python, on any related tech-stack
* You can use any framework or libraries you are comfortable with to achieve the required tasks

## Submissions
* Your submission should be a `.zip` file labeled `{{your_name}}.zip` containing your source files
* The `.zip` file should contain a `README` describing how to compile/run your test
